# schedule-planner-web

Sources for the frontend code for the schedule-planner tool.

## Install

This project builds on
    - [Schedule Planner](//github.com/JustusAdam/schedule-planner)
    - [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), though it is usable without.
    - [Elm](//elm-lang.org)

Install schedule-planner.

Download foundation and paste the files into the repository (as needed by index.html).

Install the elm platform.

Compile the project using `elm-make src/Main.elm`

Open index.html.

The Code is not wired to the actual tool yet. As soon as it is, there will be documentation on how to run a local instance.
